<p> we both walked from the myrtle-broadway J into kiwis at the same time. I picked up a watermelon on my way in and you gave me a nod while
ordering a juice.I grabbed a coors tall boy, paid and walked back past you while you were still waiting and opened my beer on the way out the door. you said “nice” and I kept walking. should’ve stopped but scared I guess :/

<p> I was sitting on a bench outside of a coffee shop this afternoon on the north side of 13th between the New School and  another Parsons building. You were leaning on a locked up bike talking to a friend but you kept making eye contact with me. You glanced at me again right before you and your friend parted ways.

I was DJing at cafe erzulie and you came in with your friends. I would look over to where you guys were standing to see if you were vibing  to my set, I think you liked it. We made eye contact three times, you were wearing a green rain jacket with green cargo pants on.I finished my set and   you were still there but I was too nervous to ask for your number. Pride got the best of me.

  you worked at the coffee shop down the street from my apartment. I️ hated the coffee but would come in anyway. it took me months to work up the courage to ask for your number, and on the morning I️ finally did, a note was taped to the shop’s front door: “gone out of business.” I️ wish I️ had asked for your number one day sooner.

<p>I was playing Pinball at Birdy’s.
You complimented my technique and psychic abilities. You asked me to choose between the game and you and then quickly disappeared into the night. I chose the game and lost you.

<p>you were at that deli off Bowery and Stanton. We were both trying to order when you noticed the 	crystals on my necklace, about the same time I noticed the ones on your earrings. We joked about being witches for a bit before our orders were ready. I should have gotten 	your number right there, but I let you cut ahead of me in line instead.

<p>you have dark hair and dark eyes, i pass you on some part of graham avenue multiple times a week. we always act like we never see each other, even when i feel your stare i pretend not to notice. we’ve met once but i was too shy to ask you anything. i don’t know if you’re as shy as me or if we will ever meet again, but i always look forward to walking to the train.

<p>You: long blond Legolas hair, reading a book. We were sitting in the same row at Anthology Film Achive last night, waiting to see a 9pm showing of Balthasar.
Me: with a different guy but wishing I was next to you. Pls HM if you’re taking your steed out on  a joy ride any time soon and require an elven companion.

<p>Your name is Ben and you were wearing a
painter’s jacket, but told me you were a drummer in a punk band. We talked for awhile about playing music and New York and I wish I asked for your number before you disappeared into the dance floor.

<p>you were sitting at a table with your friends and i was sitting at the bar with mine. we exchanged a long, intentional gaze as you waited in the bathroom line but before you made your way back to your seat, i was being pulled to the next bar. i hesitated over a cigarette outside but as i lingered halfway down the block, you stepped outside for some fresh air. i turned around twice to see if you were watching. you were. wish i would have stayed and asked to borrow a light.
